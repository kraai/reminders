A web version of
[Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890).  You can see it
live at <https://ftbfs.org/~kraai/reminders/>.

Things to add:

* Sharing across browsers and devices (i.e., a backend).
* Preventing empty or duplicate reminders (i.e., input validation)
* Nested reminders (oh my!)
